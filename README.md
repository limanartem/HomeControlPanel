# About #

This is my home pet project for Raspberry PI 3 powered with Windows 10 IoT Core and hosting my UWP App.

Initial idea was to create some electronic wall mounted calendar for our family appointments, which I was planning to implement using simple Google calendar hosted in full screen browser. So I bought Raspberry PI 3 and a 10" touch screen. And then I realised that calendar is too easy and I decided to extent the app with a couple of more widgets, like:

* Current date and time
* Weather forecast
* Nearby public transport stops and transport real time time tables
* Room temperature and humidity (using DH22 sensor)
* and of course, calendar with appointments 
* also app can switch to dark or light theme depending on the ambient light sensor reads
...and certainly there are even more ideas on what can be added there
